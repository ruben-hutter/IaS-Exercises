**Conclusion:**
The packagesize doesn't seem to have a significant effect on the Round-Trip-Time.

10.36.253.6
130.59.36.114
130.59.36.69

## Exercise 3
a)
**Circuit Switching:**
As an exclusive connection between each party is established the full individual bandwith of 2 MB/s is allocated for each user. Therefore the maximum amount of users is (10 MB/s)/(2 MB/s) = 5.
**Packet Switching:**
In the worst case, all users are active simultaneously. To ensure that our shared connection is never overloaded we can't support more than 5 users as 5*(2 MB/s) = (10 MB/s).
We can however allow a small chance of our connection to get overloaded, leading to delay and package drop. The chance that more than 5 users are active simultaneously can be calculated by the following formula:

The number of supported users lies in our choice of the chance with wich we allow our shared connection to be overloaded.

b)

i)
The maximum achievable bandwith on the specified route is  limited by the proxy with the lowest traffic limit. As proxy D has a traffic limit of 512 KB/s this is equal to the maximum achievable bandwith.
As 2 GB = 2'000 MB = 2'000'000 KB, we need (2'000'000 KB / 512 KB) = 3906.25 s = aprox 65 min 6s = 1 h 5 min 6s to transfer the 2 GB of data.

ii)
- processing delay
- queueing delay
- transmission delay
- propagation delay

## Exercise 4
a)
The following steps were necessary to setup ssh servers on both vms:
- install openssh-server using `sudo apt install openssh-server ` on Debian and `apk add openssh` on alpine.
- enable the ssh service at boot time using `rc-update add sshd`. On Debian, the service is enabled on boot by default so this step isn't required on Debian.
- start the service using `sudo service ssh start` on Debian and `service sshd start` on Alpine.

b)
Both VMs van be accessed using the command `ssh username@x.x.x.x` with x.x.x.x being the servers ip address.
## Exercise 5
a)
With our setups, VMs hypervised by QEMU on arch linux host no changes to the config where necessary for a ssh connection from one VM to the other. btw we use arch.
b)
To setup ssh key-pair based login we have to execute the following steps:
- create a new key-pair using `ssh-keygen`.
- enter a name for the new key-pair when prompted
- transfer the public key to the server using `ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/keyname.pub user@192.168.122.62`.
c)
I didn't have to save anything as it worked out of the box xD
d)
- SCP/sFTP the text-file to either VM: `scp file.txt tobi@192.168.122.62:/home/user/`
- use RPC to rename the file by executing `ssh tobi@192.168.122.62 "mv /home/tobi/Documents/test_file.txt /home/tobi/Documents/renamed_file.txt"`.
- login by SSH with `ssh tobi@192.168.122.62`. Then use the commands `cd directory` and `nano filename` to edit the file.
- SCP/sFTP from the client to pull back the file using the command `scp file tobi@192.168.122.62:/home/tobi/Documents/renamed_file.txt /home/tobi/uni_basel/internet_and_security/ias-exercise-2/`.
- copy files directly to the other one by using the command `scp tobi@ipaddress1:/path tobi@ipadress2:/path`.
- The -3 has the effect that "Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local host. Without this option the data is copied directly between the two remote hosts. Note that, when using the original SCP protocol (the default), this option selects batch mode for the second host as scp cannot ask for passwords or passphrases for both hosts. This mode is the default." (source: man scr)

## Exercise 6
a)
Arch (host):
- Run the command 'sudo pacman -Syu' to synchronize and update the packages database.
- Install wireshark using 'sudo pacman -S wireshark-qt'.
- Grant execution permission to '/usr/bin/dumpcap' by executing 'sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/dumpcap'.

Debian:
- Run the command 'sudo apt update' to synchronize and update the packages database.
- Install wireshark using 'sudo apt install wireshark'.
- Grant execution permission to '/usr/bin/dumpcap' by executing 'sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/dumpcap'.

Alpine:
- Enable community repositories by uncommenting '"https://<mirror-server>/alpine/<version>/community"' in the config file '/etc/apk/repositories'.
- Run 'apk update' to update the index of the available packages.
- Install wireshark with 'apk add wireshark'.
- Grant execution permission to '/usr/bin/dumpcap' by executing 'sudo chod +x /usr/bin/dumpcap'. 

b)
Desktopenvironments on Linux use the X-Server to communicate with the GUI. As this communication uses the internal network of the machine, the server can also be located on an entirely different machine like a ssh client accessing a server over a network that runs a gui application. The graphics are then rendered on the ssh client's X-Server according to the data of the ssh server.
To use this X-forwarding the following steps are necessary:
- In the config-file '/etc/ssh/sshd_config' on the ssh server, set the parameter 'X11Forwarding' to 'yes'
- Now we can connect to the server by running 'ssh -X user@serveraddress' on the ssh client
- Then we can launch a gui application over the shell resulting in the gui being displayed in a window on our ssh client.
- Alternatively we can directly connect and launch an application by using 'ssh -X user@serveraddress path_to_application'.

## Exercise 7
a)
Running wireshark as root is dangerous as every explit in the sofware ir running with administrator priviledges and can therefor acces and modify nearly everything on the machine.

b)
Debian:

Alpine:
